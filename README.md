# Blockchain Commons #SmartCustody White Papers

**#SmartCustody White Papers** is a set of standalone white papers that have also been compiled in the [#SmartCustody Book](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/SmartCustodyBook).

_At this point, the White Papers may be a somewhat older version of the text than the Book, which also contains papers on a variety of other topics; we are undecided on whether we should maintain this separate repo of individual papers._

## Additional Information

The following files contain…

* [Simple Self-Custody Cold Storage Scenario](%23SmartCustody-_Simple_Self-Custody_Cold_Storage_Scenario.md) — Best Practices for Protecting Your Personal Digital Assets Using Cold Storage _(Version: 2019-03-25 Release 1.0.0)_

## Status - Late Alpha

**#SmartCustody White Papers** is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:
