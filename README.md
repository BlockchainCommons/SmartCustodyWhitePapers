### What is #SmartCustody?

> _**"The use of advanced cryptographic tools to improve the care, maintenance, control, and protection of digital assets."**_

Our goals:

- To raise the bar on best practices for digital-asset custodianship by building a greater understanding of different custody use cases, risk models, and adversary threats.
- To prepare for new custody technologies that break old models for custodianship.

To accomplish these goals, we are creating a series of best-practices white papers and also offering a series of different workshops on these topics. We are additionally collaborating with cryptographic industry and regulatory stakeholders to establish standards, improve best practices, and create new cryptographic key-management and custody technologies.

Our next workshop is April 29th, 2019, see [Smart Custody: Simple Cold Storage & Self-Custody Workshop](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/smartcustody-simple-cold-storage-self-custody-workshop-tickets-59357758654).
